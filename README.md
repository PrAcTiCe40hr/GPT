## Overview
By reading literature, using online, analyzing and comparing different ChatGPT-like products, you can understand the hottest and most commercially valuable artificial intelligence direction. Through two different characteristic projects (report & python), students with different programming foundations can equip with (1) some knowledge about NLP, LLM and their applications and/or (2) Apps based on ChatGPT-like products.

## Prerequisite
A ChatGPT account: Register at https://chat.openai.com/ (Note: OpenAI does not provide serivces in the Chinese area, you have to have an non-Chinese IP to access ChatGPT \& other OpenAI products)

* Report project: Basic understanding of scientific writing \& comparative studies \& data analysis.

* Python project: Expertise in Python (need to take a coding test) \& basic understanding of machine learning.

## Preclass session
Introduction to basic usage of GitHub

### Suggested readings
Please see the `suggested_reading` folder. Optional and recommended for advanced students

### Python Project Descriptions
- Choice 1: Using GPT-like models/apps to develop your own app (Advanced). Examples: [ChatGPT Next Web](https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web), [ChatBox](https://github.com/Bin-Huang/chatbox), [ChatGPT Academic](https://github.com/binary-husky/chatgpt_academic), [wechat-chatgpt](https://github.com/fuergaosi233/wechat-chatgpt), ...
- Choice 2: Use [Chatterbot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot) to design your own chatbot
- Any other ideas are welcome

### Comparative Study Project Descriptions
- Examine the ability of GPT-like models/products in a selected fields. Analyze \& compare their performances. Explore their advantages \& limitations. Foresee the path to AGI.
- Any other ideas are welcome


## Potential research/software development collaboration oppotunity

For the students who complete both poster/presentation and report/python projects, it is possible to work together with the instructors on developmenst of open-source software based on LLM or AI4Sci research.
