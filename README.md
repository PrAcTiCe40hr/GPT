# Introduction to GPT and LLM for High School Students
This is the course page for PalmDrive **Introduction to GPT and LLM for High School Students**
If you have interests for this course, please chat with [PalmDrive](https://palmdrive.cn)


## Overview
By reading literature, using online, analyzing and comparing different ChatGPT-like products, you can understand the hottest and most commercially valuable artificial intelligence direction. Through two different characteristic projects (report & python), students with different programming foundations can equip with (1) some knowledge about NLP, LLM and their applications and/or (2) Apps based on ChatGPT-like products.

## Instructor
- Dr. Sherry Lixue Cheng (Full-time, Lecture + all projects). Research interests: AI4Sci(科学人工智能). Google scholar: [Link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hy_oauIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works)


- Jiace Sun (Part-time, only assist python projects) Research interests: Quantum computing, AI4Sci. Google scholar: [Link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Glz95w4AAAAJ&hl=en)


## Prerequisite
A ChatGPT account: Register at https://chat.openai.com/ (Note: OpenAI does not provide serivces in the Chinese area, you have to have an non-Chinese IP to access ChatGPT \& other OpenAI products)

* Report project: Basic understanding of scientific writing \& comparative studies \& data analysis.

* Python project: Expertise in Python (need to take a coding test) \& basic understanding of machine learning.

### Python Project Descriptions (TBA)


### Comparative Study Project Descriptions (TBA)


## Potential research/software development collaboration oppotunity

For the students who complete both poster/presentation and report/python projects, it is possible to work together with the instructors on developmenst of open-source software based on LLM or AI4Sci research.
