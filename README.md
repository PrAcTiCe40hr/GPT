## Overview
By reading literature, using online, analyzing and comparing different ChatGPT-like products, you can understand the hottest and most commercially valuable artificial intelligence direction. Through two different characteristic projects (report & python), students with different programming foundations can equip with (1) some knowledge about NLP, LLM and their applications and/or (2) Apps based on ChatGPT-like products.
